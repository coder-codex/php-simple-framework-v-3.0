This repo contains the source code needed to develop the `simple` framework.

This is the 3.0 version of the `simple` framework.

Updates from  V 2.0 to V 3.0 :

<pre>

Data can now be transferred from the `action` to the `view`.

Enhancements were made to the `DefaultController` methods within the `backend` alias.

The information gets transferred from the `action` to the `viev` thru the `render` method.

The source code for the `render` method cand be found by accessing `vendor/framework/controllers/Controller.php`.

</pre>

Clone the repo, study the source code, investigate the flow, learn the logic behind the code.

Enjoy :)
